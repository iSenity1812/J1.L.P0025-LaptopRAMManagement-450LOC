# Background

A computer shop specializes in managing laptop RAM. The shop organizes RAM modules by type (e.g., 
LPDDR5, DDR5, LPDDR4, DDR4…), and within each type, RAM modules are further categorized by bus speed 
(e.g., 5600MHz, 4800MHz…). Finally, each bus speed category is sorted by brand. The shop requires a 
management system to efficiently handle the inventory of RAM modules

## Program Specifications
Build a management program. With the following basic functions
1. Build Your Data Structure:
- Create data structures to manage RAM items, including attributes such as 
code, type, bus, brand, quantity, and production_month_year.
2. Add an Item:
- Add a new RAM item to the collection.
- Ensure the code is unique and validate all other fields.
3. Search SubMenu:
- Search items by type, bus, brand.
- Option to return to the main menu.
4. Update Item Information:
- Update existing RAM item information by code.
- Validate and apply changes to the specified fields.
5. Delete Item:
- Mark a RAM item as inactive (active = false) upon confirmation.
- Ensure inactive items are not displayed in lists.
6. Show All Items:
- Display all active RAM items, sorted by type, bus, and brand.
7. Store Data to Files:
- Save the list of RAM items to a file and load data at program startup.
8. Quit Menu:
- Provide an option to safely exit the program.
Each menu choice should invoke an appropriate function to perform the selected menu item. Your 
program must display the menu after each task and wait for the user to select another option until 
the user chooses to quit the program.
